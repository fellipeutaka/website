## Who am I

I'm a Full Stack Developer in Brazil. I am <DisplayAge /> and creating web, mobile, and desktop applications. I am passionate about technology and programming. I am always looking for new challenges and learning new things. I am currently working with TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and other technologies.

My first contact with programming was in 2014 (I was 9 years old) when I tried to create my first mod for [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) using Java. Then I tried to create a Windows Form game using Visual Basic in 2017. But I only started studying web technologies in 2020, when I started my Systems Development course.

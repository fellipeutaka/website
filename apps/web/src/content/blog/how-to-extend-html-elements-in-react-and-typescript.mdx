In this article, we will learn how to extend HTML elements in React and TypeScript. We will create a custom `Button` component that extends the native `button` element.

## JavaScript

In React, you can extend HTML elements by creating a new component that wraps the existing element. This allows you to add custom functionality or styling to the element.

Let's create a custom `Button` component that extends the native `button` element in JavaScript:

```jsx title="button.jsx"
export function Button(props) {
  return <button {...props} />;
}
```

## TypeScript

The first question that comes to mind when you migrate from JavaScript to TypeScript is how to type the `props` parameter.
In TypeScript, there is a type helper called `React.ComponentProps` that allows you to infer the props type of a native HTML element or a custom component.

Let's type the `Button` component using `React.ComponentProps`:

```tsx title="button.tsx"
export function Button(props: React.ComponentProps<"button">) {
  return <button {...props} />;
}
```

## Forwarding refs

In this example, we used `React.ComponentProps<"button">` to infer the props type of the native `button` element.
The `Button` component props are now typed according to the `button` element props, including the `ref` prop.
However, you may know that the `ref` prop is not forwarded to the underlying `button` element by default.
To fix this, you need to forward the ref using the `React.forwardRef` function.

Let's update the `Button` component to forward the ref:

```tsx title="button.tsx"
import { forwardRef } from "react";

export const Button = forwardRef<
  HTMLButtonElement,
  React.ComponentProps<"button">
>((props, ref) => {
  return <button ref={ref} {...props} />;
});
```

There is 2 problems with this code:

1. The `ref` prop is included in the `React.ComponentProps<"button">` type.
2. The `ref` type only works because we are using the `ref` in the `button` element.

To fix the first problem, you need to exclude the `ref` prop from the `React.ComponentProps<"button">` type.
There is a utility type called `Omit` that allows you to exclude properties from an object type.
But the React also includes a utility type called `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef` that excludes the `ref` prop from the props type.

Let's update the `Button` component to use `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`:

```tsx title="button.tsx"
import { forwardRef } from "react";

export const Button = forwardRef<
  HTMLButtonElement,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"button">
>((props, ref) => {
  return <button ref={ref} {...props} />;
});
```

Now, the `Button` component props are typed according to the `button` element props without the `ref` prop, since it is forwarded to the underlying `button` element.

And to fix the second problem, you can use the `React.ComponentRef` type to infer the ref type of the component.

Let's update the `Button` component to use `React.ComponentRef`:

```tsx title="button.tsx"
import { forwardRef } from "react";

export const Button = forwardRef<
  React.ComponentRef<"button">,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<"button">
>((props, ref) => {
  return <button ref={ref} {...props} />;
});
```

## React 19

The code above is kind of ugly, but in React 19, the `ref` prop will be [automatically forwarded to the underlying `button` element.](https://react.dev/blog/2024/04/25/react-19#ref-as-a-prop)
So, you don't need to use the `React.forwardRef` function anymore.

Let's update the `Button` component to remove the `React.forwardRef` function:

```tsx title="button.tsx"
export function Button(props: React.ComponentProps<"button">) {
  return <button {...props} />;
}
```

Remember to use the `React.ComponentProps` instead of the `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef` type, since the `ref` prop is now forwarded to the underlying `button` element.

## Conclusion

In this article, we learned how to extend HTML elements in React and TypeScript. We created a custom `Button` component that extends the native `button` element and typed it using `React.ComponentProps` and `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef`.

A REST API for managing homeworks. This project was created to help me manage my homeworks
and create a API using the SOLID principles.

## Why Yagami?

I named this project Yagami because I'm a fan of the anime Death Note, and the main character is Light Yagami.
So, I decided to name this project Yagami because it's a project to manage homeworks, and Light Yagami is a very smart and organized student.

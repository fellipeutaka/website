A desktop application to manage your Minecraft servers. It allows you to create, delete, start, stop, and open the server folder.
You can also read the server logs and manage the server settings.

## Motivation

My first time creating a Minecraft server was using Hamachi. I had to follow a tutorial on YouTube to set up the server, and it was pretty easy.
However, it was a bit annoying to start and stop the server, and everyone had to be connected to Hamachi to play.
My second time creating a server was using the official Minecraft server software. It was a bit more complicated, but I managed to set it up.
I had to use the terminal to start and stop the server, and I had to edit the `server.properties` file to change the server settings.
I thought it would be nice to have a desktop application to manage the server, so I decided to create Satoru.

## Why Satoru?

Satoru is the name of a character from the anime [Jujutsu Kaisen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu_Kaisen).
I chose this name because he's the honored one.

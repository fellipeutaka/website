A CLI to scaffold web, desktop, mobile and server apps, with custom import alias, linter, tester framework and more.

## Motivation

I created this project to help me scaffold new projects faster and with the same structure and configurations.
I was tired of configuring the same things in each project, so I decided to create a CLI to automate this process.
For example, always when I start a new backend project with Fastify, I need to configure the same things like ESLint, Prettier, Jest, etc.
With Kenji, I can create a new project with all these configurations in a few seconds. And it also includes all scripts that I need.

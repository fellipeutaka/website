## Introduction

Radix UI and React Aria Components are two libraries that provide a set of accessible UI components for React applications.
Both libraries aim to make it easier for developers to create accessible user interfaces by providing a set of components
that are designed to be accessible out of the box.

In this article, we'll compare Radix UI and React Aria Components to help you decide which library is the best fit for your
project.

## Radix UI

Radix UI is a collection of low-level UI components that are designed to be accessible, composable, and unstyled. The library
provides a set of components that can be used to build custom UI components that are accessible by default.

Radix UI components are designed to be composable, which means that you can combine them to create more complex UI components.
The library provides a set of hooks that can be used to build custom components that are accessible and performant.

Radix UI components are unstyled, which means that they don't come with any default styles. This allows you to style the
components however you like, using your own CSS or a CSS-in-JS library like Emotion or Styled Components.

## React Aria Components

React Aria Components is a collection of accessible UI components that are designed to be used in React applications. The
library provides a set of components that are designed to be accessible out of the box, with support for keyboard navigation,
screen readers, and other assistive technologies.

React Aria Components provides a set of high-level UI components that are designed to be easy to use and customize. The
library provides a set of hooks that can be used to build custom components that are accessible and performant.

React Aria Components comes with default styles that are designed to be accessible and responsive. The library provides a
set of themes that can be used to customize the appearance of the components, or you can use your own CSS to style the
components however you like.
